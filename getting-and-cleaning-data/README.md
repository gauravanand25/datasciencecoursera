##Description
The main script to generate tidy data set is run_analysis.R
It includes the following:
* Merges training and test sets.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Tidy Data
tidy_data.txt is available in the repository. It contains the average ( for mean and standard deviation measurements) of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Code Book
A codebook, CodeBook.md, is available in the repository. It describes the variables, the dataset.
